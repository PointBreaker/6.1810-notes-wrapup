## 6.1810 Operating System Lecture Notes Wrap-up

Course Website: [6.1810/Operating Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2022/schedule.html)
### Intuition

The original lecture notes are in txt format, and example codes are in separate files.
I want to make it easier to read and understand, so I wrap them up in markdown format.

### Usage

Read... You can use `git clone` to download the whole repository, or just click the file you want to read, pull request if you find any mistakes.

### My lab solution

> for reference only, my implementation is not perfect
> welcome to discuss with me (do not pull request)
